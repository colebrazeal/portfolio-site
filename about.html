                Hello, My name is Cole Brazeal! I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with over two years of experience crafting 
                responsive and visually appealing web applications. 
                My journey in web development began at <a href="https://www.codeboxx.com/" target="_blank">Codeboxx</a> with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                as well as frameworks like React, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. 
                <br>
                I hold a "Frontend Developer Certification" from my Bootcamp at <a href="https://www.codeboxx.com/" target="_blank">Codeboxx</a> with experience in Full-Stack through my course as well. 
                I have professional experience working as a Web Developer at <a href="https://www.tdsynnex.com/na/us/" target="_blank">TD SYNNEX</a>, 
                where I contributed to numerous successful projects over a span of 1.5 years. 
                My proficiency in WordPress, Ceros, and Webflow further enhances my ability to 
                deliver comprehensive web solutions.
                <br>
                One of my key strengths lies in my ability to solve complex problems independently while appreciating 
                concise and accurate code solutions. 
                I thrive on learning new technologies and continuously seek opportunities to grow and improve my skills.
                <br>
                Currently, I'm working on various projects, including an innovative image understanding tool and a dynamic carousel feature for a website. 
                I am also exploring creative design elements such as responsive images and gradient borders to enhance user experience.
                <br>
                Beyond my professional life, I have a deep love for fashion, music, and experiencing new cultures. 
                I am considering exciting opportunities in diverse cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, Tampa, 
                Miami, New York City, and Tokyo, where I can continue to grow both personally and professionally.
                <br>
                I'm eager to bring my enthusiasm, creativity, and technical expertise to a forward-thinking company. 
                Let's build something amazing together!
